I was very awake at midnight one night and I wanted to code a quick game. I have a game that I always play with my best friend, Kyle. We try to guess a word from a given topic and see if we are thinking the same thing. This is my attempt of trying to implement that, but more competitively. 

Creation time: 
4/15/2024 midnight --> 4/16/2024 

How to Play: 
For each topic, I have an answer. Your job is to try to guess what the word I thought of is. All the guesses are just one word with only non-capitalized letters. If you guess correct, your high score will increase and you will move on to the next topic. If you guess incorrectly, you will have unlimited chances to guess again. Your goal is to reach the highest score possible. 

Have fun!
